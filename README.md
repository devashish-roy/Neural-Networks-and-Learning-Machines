ANN, RNN, CNN, SNN

- ANN Exercise 1 - To learn the central building blocks of ANNs, Implemented a neural network including the forward (inference) pass and the backward (learning) pass from scratch using numpy.
- ANN Exercise 2 - Implemented basic RNN using numpy and LSTM using pytorch.
- ANN Exercise 3 - CNN, Transfer learning (Fine tuning, Feature extraction)
- SNN Exercise 1 - Introduction to Spiking neural networks (SNN)
- SNN Exercise 2 - Synaptic plasticity and learning in SNN
